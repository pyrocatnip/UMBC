# Chapter 2
## Terminology
### Concepts
* **Cognitive Neuroscience**: The study of the phsyological basis of cognition.
- **Principle of neurorepresentation**: States that everything a person experience is based on reprsentations.

- **Levels of analysis**: Refers to the idea tat the topic can be studied in a number of different ways, with each approach contributing to its own dimension to our understanding.
- **Neurons**: Cells that create and transmit information about what we experience and know.
- **Nerve net**: A network of a continious, highway-like system connecting neurons together.
- **Neuron doctrine**: The idea that an individual cell tramits signals in the nervous system. and that these cells are not continious with out cells (Opposite of the nerve net theroy).
- **Cell body**: The metabolic center of the neuron; contains the mechanisms to keep the cell alive.
- **Dendrites**: Cells that branch out from the cell body in order to recieve signals.
- **Axon / Nerve fibers**: Long processes that send signals to other neurons.
- **Synapse**: The small gap between the end of a neuron's axon and the dendrite or cell body of another neuron. 
- **Resting potential**: The value that stays the same when there are no signals in the neurons
- **Action potention**: 
- **Neurotransmitter**: A chemical that makes it possible for signals to be transmitted across the synaptic gap to a dendire or to the cell body of another neuron.
- **Nerve impulse**: Transmitted down the axon. As the impulse passes the recording electrode, the charge inside the axon rises to +40 million volts, compared to the outside.
- **Feature detectors**: Neurons that respond to specific stimulus features such as orientation, movement, and length
- **Experience-dependent plasticity**: The idea that certain parts of the brain are responsible for specific functions.
-  **Neuropsychology**: The study of people with brain damage.

### Biological terminology
#### Parts of the Brain ####
- **Occipital lobe**: The part of the brain where the occipital lobe is.
- **Parietal lobe**: The part of the brain that is responible for perceptions of touch such as pain and pressure.
- **Frontal lobe**: The part of the brain responible for recieving signals form all of senses and is responsible for coordinating senses, as well higher cognitive functions such as thinking and problem solving.
- **Visual cortex**: The part of the brain that is responsible for vision.
- **Broca's area**: The region of the frontal lobe responsible for the creation of language.

- **Hierarchical processing**: The progression from lower to higher functioning.
- **Sensory coding**: How neurons represent various characteristics of the environment.
- **Specificity coding**: The idea that an object could be represented by the firing of a specialized neuron that responds only to that object.
- **Population coding**: The representation of a particular object by the pattern of firing multiple large neurons.
- **Sparse coding**: Occurs when a particular object is represented by a pattern of firing of firing only a small group of neurons with the majority of neurons remaining silent.
- **Localization of function**: Specific functions are performed by specific areas of the brain.
- **Cortical equipotentiality**: The idea that the brain is operated as an indivisible whole.
- **Wernicke's aphasia**: A condition caused by a stroke affectin the Wernicke's area. Causes fluent speech that is incoherent.
- **Double dissasciation**: Occurs if damage to one area of the brain causes function A to be absent while function b is present, and vice versa. 
- **Brain imaging**: Techniques to create a view of brain function.
- **Functional magnetic resource imaging (fMRI)**: Uses neuron activity bringing in blood into the brain responsing to the magnetism.
- **Voxel**: Small, cube-shaped areas of the brain responsible for percieving things such as images.
- **Fusiform face area (FFA)**: The part of the brain that is responsible for recognitizing faces.
- **Parahippocampal place area (PPA)**: The part of the brain that is responsible for perception of indoor / outdoor places.
- **Extrastriate body area (EBA)**: Area of the brain responsible for recongizing people, except for faces.
- **Multidimensional**: 

### Conditions of the Brain
* **Wernicke's area**: The region of the frontal lobe responsible for the comprehension of language.
- **Broca's aphasia**: A condition caused by a stroke causing a difficulty with speech, slurred and ungrammatical speech.
- **Prosopagnosia**: The inability to recognize faces.
